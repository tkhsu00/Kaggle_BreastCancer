# Kaggle_BreastCancer

## **Objective**
The objective of this project was to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on 30 features that are generated from digitized images of breast tumor, including radius, texture, and concavity. 

## **Method**
1. Compare the accuracy and F1-score of common Machine Learning approaches, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Tree**.
2. Apply automated feature engineering tool **featuretools** to generate more features. Remove features that are highly correlated or provide little additional information.
3. Perform feature selection using Random Forest and rebuilt the model based on the top important features
